# Sentiment-Infused Stock Price Prediction

A robust hybrid model to predict the next dayâ€™s closing price range for individual stocks using a deep learning ensemble approach.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Model Architecture: Integrated LSTM and GRU models in an ensemble framework to enhance forecast accuracy and generalization.

Stock-specific Models: Trained separate models for each stock using the past 4 years of historical data to capture individual market behavior patterns.

Time-Series Strategy: Used a 60-day price window as input to forecast the next day's closing price range.

Sentiment Integration: Incorporated news sentiment analysis to account for real-time market sentiment and improve prediction reliability.

Ensemble Output: Combined predictions from LSTM, GRU, and a meta-model to generate a more stable and accurate forecast.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NLTK/VADER, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, yFinance API
